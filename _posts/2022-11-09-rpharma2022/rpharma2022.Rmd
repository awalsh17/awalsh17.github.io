Katie Igartua, PhD (Sr Director, Computational Biology at Tempus) and I presented the opening keynote at R/Pharma 2022 on October 8th.

Thanks to the organizers for having me and making this a very positive experience! Double thanks to Katie for agreeing to take this on with me and then brainstorming a (hopefully) interesting topic.

I will update here when a recording goes up on YouTube. Until then, here is a link to the [slides](./slides/RPharma2022_walsh_igartua.pdf)

If you want to get in touch to talk more about ideas to engage to help people get hired and find good people in the R/Pharma community, do reach out. The best way to get in touch at the moment is probably [LinkedIn]().
